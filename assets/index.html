<p>Are you an adventurous traveler, looking to make the leap from the page to the jungle&hellip; if so, this book is without a doubt for you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learning to play with lions testicles&rdquo; eloquently combines both the internal and external challenges the author faces, be it elephants, torrential storms, or the guilt and recovery of a lost loved one.</p>
<p>Honestly, the title here is all cheek. Playing with a lions testicles, of course, referring to a foolhardy task. That said, there&rsquo;s nothing foolhardy about digging into a new book.</p>

<p>Do squirrels always seem one step ahead of the game to you? I know they did for me&hellip; but after this book, I can call them thoroughly and utterly outwitted.</p>
<p>Honestly, I can say that now as I walk down the street, the squirrels turn their heads as to not make eye contact. It&rsquo;s truly a liberating feeling.</p>
<p>There are, as the title suggests a full 101 stratagems within these 240 pages, and honestly, it proves itself to be the best guidebook out there since the 2nd, and 1st edition.</p>

<p>I had lived my life as a lone toilet paper-folding enthusiast, though, upon leaving the privy, left a single toilet paper rose.</p>
<p>Someone found that rose, stalking through the establishment, trying to find their toilet paper Adonis, for the rose held such beauty. And that my friend, is how I met your mother.</p>

<p>The Huffington Post says: “It caught our attention.” &hellip; and that&rsquo;s all you really need to know before you take the leap and join the immensely immense world of crafting with cat hair.</p>

      <p><em>The fact of the matter is, if you have something to teach, people will want to learn. And this book teaches a lot.</em></p>
<p>No book in this list has riled up the critics in such a controversial way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are these images, and why not?&rdquo; ~ are some of the questions you may ask. But this book is here for a reason&hellip; and the first step is understanding that. The second step is accepting it.</p>

      <p><em>At the end of the day, there&rsquo;s nothing interesting about good taxidermy.</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often overlooked that when you&rsquo;re on your way to mastering an art, you have to sometimes make a few crappy versions of, well, whatever you&rsquo;re working on to get to the top. You won&rsquo;t really be surprised to find that taxidermy is no exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Now, if staring at re-animated animals like that weird guy in American Beauty does it for you, then you&rsquo;re in for a true treat, as Crap Taxidermy puts on display some of the strangest, weirdest, spine-tingling, very often act-against-mother-nature level displays including many a one-eyed beast.</p>
<p>For me though, I consider this book the opposite of a coffee table talk piece. Something that will make your guests perfectly uncomfortable, and make in-laws, who have known you for 10+ years begin to question whether they ever &ldquo;actually&rdquo; knew you at all&hellip;</p>

<p>The topic of cannibalism is not a sticky one. It&rsquo;s pretty set in stone, so you won&rsquo;t find any strange information coming from me when it comes down to brass tacks&hellip; that said, in this world&rsquo;s competitive environment, you&rsquo;re going to need to find an edge. And if you don&rsquo;t, someone else will.</p>
<p>That being said, if you are the kind of person who likes to talk about their I.Q. &hellip; perhaps casually bringing it up in conversation at the dinner table, parties, or generally silent rooms, then maybe there is some useful information in here that might pique your fancy, and give you those extra few intelligence quotient points, allowing you to topple the inferior squabble that is the humans of this world.</p>

<p>My middle school teacher always told me, &ldquo;When you don&rsquo;t understand something, sit down, and slowly try to deconstruct it.&rdquo; So let us do just that, and see if we come to any conclusions about this book. Which I will also note, is only volume one.</p>
<p>So, my best friend&rsquo;s mom is a sasquatch. I can accept this reality.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if she&rsquo;s a sasquatch. I guess, this too I can accept. I like to think that I&rsquo;m the kind of person who wouldn&rsquo;t care if my best friend&rsquo;s mom was one.</p>
<p>But wait. I only don&rsquo;t care (if I&rsquo;m reading this right), because she&rsquo;s Hot. Well, that&rsquo;s just wrong. I&rsquo;m sure she is an amazing person. After all, she raised my best friend, and I like them!</p>
<p>OH AND I&rsquo;M WHAT!</p>

<p>Are you the kind of person who finds it easier to relate to a Tractor than a person? Did Mater from the Cars movies appear in your dreams more than just a few times? Are you thinking about your tractors right now? ~ If you answered yes to any of those questions, this book is one for you.</p>
<p>Within this book, the author opens up about small-town life, and is billed as his &ldquo;ultimate contribution to mankind&rdquo; &hellip; that is a pretty big claim, but once you&rsquo;ve got into the first few pages you&rsquo;ll be hooked.</p>
<p>The next stop will be Roger Welsch&rsquo;s other hits &ldquo;Old tractors never die&rdquo;, &ldquo;Love, Sex and Tractors&rdquo; then all stops to &ldquo;Old tractors and the men who love them&rdquo;.</p>

      <p><em>You may be outwitted by the smart ones, but these ones are more in your grasp.</em></p>
<p>There is a difficult problem to solve in national parks, as people often leave behind (rudely I might add) trash quite often near the trash cans, but surprisingly not always within them, as some of the bins have bear proofing. A park ranger was quoted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a significant overlap between the smartest bears and the dumbest people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This book is for those people (and those bears).</p>
<p>Seriously, if you&rsquo;ve tried birding, but the red cardinal and the blue Herron look no different to you. The nuance of focusing the binoculars escapes you, and you&rsquo;re nearly giving up&hellip; now you can look at birding from a whole different, slightly less sophisticated angle in a way that will bring you joy for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Also good for birder friends who are a little over the top. You know who they are.</p>

<p>Microwave for One is really the book that put Sonia Allison on the map, some say she meditated alone for in solidarity for an entire year, working her way into a trans-like state and accepting wholly and fully what it is like to be one with the microwave, and then one by one ripped the recipe&rsquo;s out of the void and wrote them into this book.</p>
<p>Each day when I get hungry, I look to the skies and think to myself, &ldquo;What would Sonia Allison do&rdquo;, the path quickly becomes clear, and a soothing wave washes over me as the gentle hum and rotation of the microwave eases my troubled soul.</p>

<p>If there is one thing that has never been further away from my Christmas list, its some of my Mom&rsquo;s recycled pantyhose creepily crafted into, as the cover outlines: dolls, wall hangings, music boxes, and holiday decorations.</p>
<p>That said, there are some incredible uses for this book.</p>
<p>Example 1: Your treasured daughter has bought home a new boyfriend, and his birthday is right around the corner. Some handily crafted pantyhose, molded into a deformed doll mildly resembling their appearance will solve that problem faster than you can say &ldquo;why does this book exist&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Example 2: You could find out how on earth does anyone make a music box with their pantyhose.</p>

      <p><em>For the adrenaline junky looking to get their fix in this modern crazy world.</em></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like me, crumpled shirts are an absolute no-no, I won&rsquo;t even leave the house with one.</p>
<p>Before I read this book I felt alone&hellip; when accidents happened, accidentally causing a crease in my otherwise perfectly cardboard-esque flat shirt, I would retreat to safety in my home&hellip; now, I&rsquo;ve seen the light, and the light is all about carrying with you the tools to iron your shirts.</p>
<p>Be it on the steep rockface of El Capitan, or the blue depths of the Great Barrier Reef, I feel comfortable knowing that I have the tools at my disposal to quickly, quietly and efficiently iron out any crumples on my clothing, and in my life.</p>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re considering a new life with a baby in it or reflecting on your days of carefree sitting, there&rsquo;s always something that can be learned.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t sit on the baby is a practical guide to get you through those early days with some very clear do&rsquo;s (feed the baby) and dont&rsquo;s (sit on the baby)&hellip; these are just a couple of little teasers if you want more, and i can tell you do, you&rsquo;re going to have to delve deep into the pages yourself!</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re finished, you&rsquo;ll have a book full of post-its and a solid understanding of how to get your baby out of those baby years, and into those toddler years where you&rsquo;ll find sitting on them is still not a thing you should do.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re sitting on the dentist&rsquo;s clean white chair, the brisk sterilized smell crosses your nose. You look over to the tools neatly arranged as you wait patiently for your inspection.</p>
<p>Open Wide, the dentist says as he snaps the gloves on his hands.</p>
<p>&hellip; Up until this point, we&rsquo;re in the mundane realm of our own lives, something we all need a break from, and that is where this book comes in!</p>
<p>You open your mouth as the semi-transparent ghost dentist peers into your mouth. &ldquo;Hmm&rdquo; he mumbles, as you peek open an eye to see his the inflection on his face, but not without taking in a big gleaming look at his clean as can be large white saber teeth.</p>
<p>You breathe out a relaxing sigh and lean back in comfort knowing that someone with teeth like these has absolutely mastered their craft.</p>

      <p><em>Yep, It&rsquo;s Wood.</em></p>
<p>You may not know it, but you are surrounded by wood. Your Dining table and chairs? Wood. The walls of your house? Wood. Literally every single tree? Wood.</p>
<p>Oh my, you&rsquo;re realizing that your ability to identify wood might be a little more important than you first thought!</p>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;re going to learn that there are hard and softwoods&hellip; try to fathom the intense power you would have if you could walk into a room and say &ldquo;yep, that&rsquo;s a soft cedar hybrid&rdquo;. Phew, that&rsquo;s a lot of power that needs to be wielded with extreme care.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m imagining the look on your face when, and this is a little spoiler, you then realize that the book itself, in an act of meta genius that would truly make M. Night Shyamalan weep, is also MADE OF WOOD. Yes, just like the mind-warping idea of the brain trying to analyze itself via the medical branch of neurology, this wood is trying to explain to you who it is, and what it is all about!</p>

      <p><em>The perfect guidebook for numbers 0 to 9 in random order!</em></p>
<p>When was the time you read a book that contained every single number in it&hellip; probably never!</p>
<p>Not only does this book contain 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s, but it also has 2&rsquo;s and 3&rsquo;s. In fact, it contains all ten numbers that exist.</p>
<p>Now, the book touts that these digits are in completely random order, but some dark edges of the internet believe there is a pattern in this book, waiting for someone with rain-man like abilities to truly decode its secrets.</p>
<p>Each night, my young son lies eagerly for me to sit and in the most monotone voice read out these numbers. A quick search says it will take approximately 12 days of straight reading to get to the end. I expect to finish by the time he turns 23.</p>

      <p><em>I know one thing for sure, it&rsquo;s that author if author Lewis Grizzard was born a millennial, he&rsquo;d be dropping the dankest memes left, right and center.</em></p>
<p>As someone who previously knew not to bend over in the garden, and that them taters (boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew) do indeed have eyes, the instructional words of the title were lost to me.</p>
<p>Even then though, Lewis Grizzard&rsquo;s greasy slicked back hair, up-way-too-high cameltoe inspiring pants, American gothic fork, and beady beady eyes stared right into my soul, leaning over he whispered the somber words &ldquo;take me home and read me&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cover of this book alone makes it worthy of the Pulitzer Prize for photography. The content of the book, which can&rsquo;t possibly be as interesting also exists.</p>

<p>As someone who prides themselves in collecting strange and boring books, I have to say, this one truly takes the cucumber&hellip; but the process is tedious.</p>
<p>Now. If you love cucumbers, sun, beams, tedious processes, or have family in New Haven then there is a chapter within this marvelous oration for you.</p>
<p>But for real, if you&rsquo;re into 1800&rsquo;s history, and have the true strength of will and mind to look past the red flags that are the cover and title of this wonder, then you&rsquo;re in for a treat; That is, a series of manuscripts for your trouble, providing insights into the lives and troubles of people who would definitely not read this if it was between that and eating 15 raw cucumbers in a row.</p>

      <p><em>Finally, someone is answering the questions we&rsquo;ve all had on our lips from the age of 14.</em></p>
<p>When it comes to dating there are endless resources, literally, endless. Enough that you could read from the age of 10 until the age of 99 and still have more to read. Interestingly though, very few websites, blogs, libraries, or archives dig into the taboo subject of pooping on dates.</p>
<p>Without giving too much away, you&rsquo;ll learn a vast array of tools to help you in those awkward situations. From the slightly too long &ldquo;just going to freshen up&rdquo; to the &ldquo;oh, the line is really big, sorry&rdquo; text message sent as you&rsquo;re sitting on the John.</p>
<p>Really though, knowing when and how to get away when you need to &ldquo;get away&rdquo; is an incredibly useful skill, and will remain useful as long as you&rsquo;re a human who needs to poop.</p>

<p>Edgar Allan Poe wept, whilst reading the ever macabre &ldquo;Do it yourself coffins&rdquo;, for he knew that there was a whole new dimension of darkness that could be bled from the pages.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re the amateur coffin maker or the do-it-yourself planner of the future, you shouldn&rsquo;t browse without at least considering this beauty.</p>
<p>Now, this doesn&rsquo;t go without warning, if you&rsquo;re the perfectionist looking for the perfect place to rest your head, reviews of this book suggest there are many some improvements that can be made&hellip; for those, I guess we&rsquo;ll be waiting for the second edition.</p>

      <p><em>Let&rsquo;s just say that you don&rsquo;t really want to go to the afterlife without a little knowledge about how it all goes down over there.</em></p>
<p>The thing about the afterlife is that you don&rsquo;t exist anymore&hellip; everything is different without the earthly tethers. And one of the things that are most different, at the very least according to this book, is sex.</p>
<p>Now, the real trick is getting a headstart on the afterlife in regular life! Especially when you exist on another plane of existence, potentially in physical form, but very likely as a fluid ectoplasm&hellip; get ahead when you can&hellip; and what better place to start than the fundamentals.</p>

<p>Oh no! You wake from a nightmare and remember that your mom is still dating weird Wayne.</p>
<p>This book is more of a guidebook than a novel: how to come up with creative ways to distract and disturb your mother as she tries to re-enter the dating world and become happy again.</p>
<p>An extra disturbing feature of this book is that there is one on sale (at the time of writing) for over $800&hellip; I guess good advice is hard to come by these days.</p>

      <p><em>Has someone dead attached themselves to you? This guide will help you, and them, move on.</em></p>
<p>There is a wonderful duality to this book. Its the kind that will help you if you&rsquo;re healthy and alive, but also, if you&rsquo;re the kind of introspective dead person it will also be a very useful resource.</p>
<p>The real treasure of this beauty is the chapters on attachment to unsuspecting bystanders, which again are relevant to both the living and dead.</p>

<p>That said, if you&rsquo;re in a deep, dark, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me dad or what I&rsquo;m going through!&rdquo; kind of mood, perhaps the idea of exploring life without humans interference is actually going to be fun! You might learn something too!</p>

      <p><em>One of the truest miracles is how a book with such an exciting title, can have the such a plain cover.</em></p>
<p>When it comes to castration, it goes without saying that being an even little informed goes a long long way. It may not be obvious to all, but the act of castration can not be undone (That&rsquo;s a CON).</p>
<p>A simple advantage is that if you&rsquo;re kicked in your private you will be numb to the pain others would receive (That is a very solid PRO).</p>
<p>These simple advantages and disadvantages barely begin to scratch the surface and historical ideas behind castration that you&rsquo;ll get in the first three pages of this powerful tome.</p>
